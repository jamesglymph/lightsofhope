				  <h2>Determining the Audience</h2>

					 <p>The audience of ALOH was tricky to determine, as the events they host seem to be meant for literally anyone. However, an interview with ALOH’s Ben Philips gave some insight as to how they target their audience. The audience of ALOH consists of people in the Anderson community, but they’re actually a minority of the audience, oddly enough. ALOH actually does a lot of advertising outside the Anderson area (about a 50-mile radius) in order to net more people who may have not heard of their events. Within these areas they primarily target families, as those are the people who come to events like the light show.
					 </p>
	         <p>I thought about volunteers and donors as obvious outlets of help for ALOH, as a lot of what they do relies on outside help. These sources of help could range from college-aged students, to other non-profits in cahoots with ALOH. In the interview, Ben Philips briefly mentioned how the city council has been an obstacle for some of their events in the past, so I took note of them as a possible skeptic.

      	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>I would say the overall goal of the ALOH website is simply to be more informative. Whether it’s details on events, their mission statement, or simply making a volunteer form, the website will not be able to serve its purpose effectively without a clear hierarchy and call to action. </p>
