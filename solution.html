				  <h2>Call to Action</h2>

					 <p>The first step of the solution was determining the CTA (Call to Action). What would be the most important elements for the user to see as soon as they opened the home page of the website. </p>

					 <div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
					 </div>

					 <p>Based on my research and interviews, I think ALOH would benefit greatly from a ‘Volunteer’ button and a
						 ‘Learn More’ button, as those are two big reasons someone would want to visit their website. They rely on
						 volunteers a lot in order to function, so their website should definitely reflect that. During my interviews with
						 users, they mentioned that they’d really want more details on what ALOH is/what they do.</p>

						 <p>Two other buttons I’ve considered are the ‘Donate’ button and the ‘View Events’ button. The donate button
						 would be helpful for obvious reasons, and the view events button would be geared toward those who already
						 know about ALOH and want to know what/where/when events are coming up.</p>
						 <p>Other buttons considered:</p>

						 <div class="box alt">
						 	<div class="row 50% uniform">
						 		<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						  </div>
						 </div>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					 <p>All of the research and brainstorming culminated into a solid direction that a redesigned ALOH website could take—with all the elements being displayed through a style tile. </p>
					 <div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/StyleTile.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
					 </div>

					 <p>I decided that a redesign for ALOH could better reflect the organization by being lively, hopeful, inviting, optimistic, communal, and supportive. To reflect this, I kept the yellow and red that were featured in the original ALOH and Anderson Christmas Lights websites—tweaking the hue of the original red to create darker tones for the color palette. These colors, paired with the typefaces Archer and Ideal Sans, made for a look and feel that reflected the organization well. </p>
						 <p>I also ended up reimagining their logo, making it a more symmetrical mark that can reflect all the adjectives previously mentioned. I also went ahead and changed Anderson Lights of Hope to its acronym ALOH, in order to hopefully eliminate any confusion that people may have had with the non-profit organization versus the Anderson Christmas Light event. </p>
						 <p>Another element that can go a long way to help the ALOH site is the potential calendar UI in the bottom right of the style tile. This element would list upcoming events chronologically, and would only feature days that actually have events, as ALOH’s event schedule tends to be spread out—negating the need for a full-on calendar.
